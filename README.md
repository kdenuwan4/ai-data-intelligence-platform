# Ai-Data-Intelligence-Platform
A data simulation and analysis platform showcasing NumPy and Pandas skills, with scalable architecture for AI applications.
Project Overview

This repository contains a step-by-step AI Data Intelligence Platform project, designed to demonstrate data manipulation, analysis, and feature engineering skills. The project starts with NumPy-based data simulation and analysis and is structured to expand into Pandas, visualization, and AI modeling layers.

Key Features:

Simulated dataset of entities with multiple numeric features.

Normalization, composite scoring, and ranking of entities.

Advanced matrix operations like feature projection for dimensionality reduction.

Fully reproducible notebooks ready for future AI integration.

Skills Highlighted:

NumPy: arrays, broadcasting, dot products, statistics, projections.

Pandas: DataFrame operations, missing value handling, aggregation, ranking.

Matplotlib (future phase): visualization of data and scores.

Project design: scalable, modular, and ready for AI modeling.

Goal:
The project is designed to showcase practical AI engineering skills and serves as a portfolio piece for freelance and professional AI work.
